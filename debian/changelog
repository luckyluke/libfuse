hurd-libfuse (0.0.20130220-2) UNRELEASED; urgency=low

  [ Pino Toscano ]
  * Make use of the debhelper compatibility 9:
    - bump compat to 9
    - bump the debhelper build dependency to >= 9
    - rules: stop specifying manually the --libdir to configure, as
      dh_auto_configure handles that on its own
    - remove the hardening-wrapper build dependency and DEB_BUILD_HARDENING=1
      in rules, since dh_auto_configure export the right *FLAGS variables
      from dpkg-buildflags (which include the basic hardening flags)
