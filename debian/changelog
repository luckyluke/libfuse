hurd-libfuse (0.0.20140820-1) experimental; urgency=medium

  * New upstream snapshot.
  * Rename libfuse-hurd0 to libfuse-hurd1, as the SONAME has been bumped.
  * Add libfuse-hurd-dbg with debug symbols.
  * Bump Standards-Version to 3.9.5, no changes required.
  * Add a real libfuse-dev, whose version is based on the FUSE API it
    implements (taken from the pkg-config file), which depends on
    libfuse-hurd-dev. This allows libfuse-hurd-dev to satisfy versioned
    libfuse-dev (build-)dependencies.
  * Remove extra ${shlibs:Depends} from libfuse-hurd-dev.
  * Update copyright.
  * Make the .install files slightly more specific.
  * Set the shlibs to the current upstream version.
  * Pass --fail-missing to dh_install, to not miss any file installed; remove
    the libtool .la file from debian/tmp, since it is not needed.
  * Add myself to Uploaders.

hurd-libfuse (0.0.20130220-2) unstable; urgency=low

  [ Pino Toscano ]
  * Make use of the debhelper compatibility 9:
    - bump compat to 9
    - bump the debhelper build dependency to >= 9
    - rules: stop specifying manually the --libdir to configure, as
      dh_auto_configure handles that on its own
    - remove the hardening-wrapper build dependency and DEB_BUILD_HARDENING=1
      in rules, since dh_auto_configure export the right *FLAGS variables
      from dpkg-buildflags (which include the basic hardening flags)
  * Rename docs to libfuse-hurd-dev.docs, and do not install NEWS for now
    (no useful content in it)
  * Do not install the upstream ChangeLog, since all it does is pointing to the
    VCS history.
  * Update Vcs-* headers.
  * Bump Standards-Version to 3.9.4, no changes required.
  * Update upstream URL in Homepage and copyright.
  * Change source section to libs, and priority to optional (matching libfuse).
  * Mark libfuse-hurd-dev as Multi-Arch: same.
